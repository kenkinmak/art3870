        <h2>Biography</h2><br>
        <p>Good morning friends! My name is Ka. I'm going to introduce myself. I was born in Hong Kong but I have been in US for 17 years. As for my family, I have just one brother. He is older than me. My parents are retired. I am a friendly person, a good thinker, and am flexible to work in any shift. I can work for longer hours without any break, if I am interested in that. My life style is very simple.
     I'm interested in many things such as music, reading novels, and watching movies. I love to read love stories and suspense thrillers.
     I'm personally interested in becoming an Animator & Graphic Designer. However, there are many different career opportunities that I like. I believe that a job should be like a hobby, enjoyable.
     It takes a long time to study an animation course. It is very difficult and requires a tremendous amount of patience and hard work. I hope that I'll be able to meet these challenges, and that my dream will come true.
     As for now, I'm only focusing my attention on enjoyment. I'm being my true self with the values, dreams and goals that I have.<br>
